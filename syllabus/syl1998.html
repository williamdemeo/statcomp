<P>
Any remaining lectures are spent on special topics such as program
maintenance, object oriented programming, and advanced UNIX programming
techniques.
<P>
The grade for this course is based on four computer projects 
which will be assigned throughout the semester.  If you feel you
have a project which would be more relevant than one of the 
assignments,
feel free to suggest it as an alternative to an assignment given
in class.
<P>
All students will be provided with a computer account on the Statistical
Computer Facilities (SCF) network of SUN Microsystems computers.  The
computer room in 491 Evans provides high resolution workstations (which
will be required for some of the assignments); 
you can also
remotely log in to the SCF system from other campus computers.  If you
wish to do your assignments on some other computer, keep in mind that
required programs may be stored on the SCF system, and it is your
responsibility to get the programs to another computer.  Additionally, some
of the assignments are oriented towards the UNIX operating system, so if you 
wish to use a non-UNIX computer, you should make sure that the necessary
resources are available.
<P>
None of the following texts are required, but interested students may 
want to consider the following books, not only for this course, but as
a useful part of their professional libraries:
