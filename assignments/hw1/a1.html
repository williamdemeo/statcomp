<li><font size="+1"><b>Function Prototypes</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Consider the following function, which adds two double precision floating 
point numbers:


<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double&nbsp;sum(double&nbsp;x,&nbsp;double&nbsp;y)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return(x&nbsp;+&nbsp;y);
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}

</pre>

For this assignment, create a file containing this function definition,
and a second file with 
a program which calls the <tt>sum</tt> function using two <b>integer</b>
arguments, and which prints the value returned by <tt>sum</tt>.  Compile and
run the program twice, first declaring sum as


<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double&nbsp;sum();

</pre>

and then using a function prototype, like


<pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;double&nbsp;sum(double,double);

</pre>

Does the value printed by the program when you use the first declaration
agree with the value when you use the function prototype?  Explain why or why 
not.

<font size="+1"><b>Determining Machine Constants</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write a program (or programs) to determine the following:

<ul>
<li><b>Largest Integer</b> What is the largest integer (both long and
short) that can be handled in the computer?  What happens when an integer becomes larger
than this due to a computation?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<b>Largest Unsigned Integer</b> What is the largest unsigned integer (both long and
short) that can be handled in the computer?  What happens when an 
unsigned integer becomes larger than this due to a computation?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<b>Largest Floating Point Number</b> What  is  the largest floating  point  
number  (both single and double 
precision) which can be handled in the computer?  What  happens
when  a  number becomes larger than this due to a computation?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<b>Machine Epsilon</b> One important constant on the computer is  the  
smallest number such that, when it is added to 1, the result is greater than 
1.  What is the value  of machine epsilon?
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The simplest way to determine these constants is to write  a
program  which starts with the number 1, and then multiplies
or divides it by 2, printing out the result at  each  stage.
These  results  can  be  examined,  and it is usually pretty
clear what the value of the constant is.  A better  solution
is   to  write  a program which can detect when the constant
has been found, and to break out of the loop and  print  the
answer  at that time.  The first solution is acceptable, but
try to aim for the second method.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Note:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the values described above can be found  in  a
header  file in the standard include directory  <tt>/usr/include</tt>.
If you can find the appropriate header file, it  may  be  of
interest  to  compare  the  results  in  that  file with the
results of your program.   (Please  note  that  finding  the
header  file does not constitute completing the assignment.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<font size="+1"><b>Probability Tables for the Chi-squared
Distribution</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write a program that will prompt a user for degrees of freedom and
probability level, and which will then print the critical 
chi-squared value.
You will need to use a subroutine from a library such as <tt>dcdflib</tt> to
calculate the critical value; look at <tt>/app/dcdflib/doc/dcdflib.fdoc</tt>
for information on how to call these routines.
You should have some 
provision in
your program to allow the user to make multiple requests, and then
terminate the program in a "graceful" way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Note:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The  dcdflib routines are written in  FORTRAN and
you'll write your main routine in C so you'll need to learn how
to call FORTRAN routines from C.  Type  <tt>help fortran_from_c</tt>
for more information.
