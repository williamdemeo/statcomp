<li><font size="+1"><b>Sweep</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write and test a subroutine to sweep the columns of a 
square matrix.  The subroutine should be written so that
the calling routine can specify which columns of the matrix are
to be swept.  This would be necessary, for example, in stepwise
regression. Test it on an 
a matrix of your choice, and try to verify the results 
through some other means.  Make sure you read and understand part
2 of the assignment before writing the subroutine, and you can 
save yourself some work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Hint:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to test the function is to sweep <em>all</em> 
the columns of 
the matrix and compare the result to the inverse of the matrix
obtained from R, matlab, etc.  You can also form a test matrix
as an augmented X<font face="symbol">¢</font
>X matrix, and use your subroutine to perform
a series of regressions, checking the results with a
package or subroutine library, or the Gram-Schmidt regression 
program you wrote for
assignment 3.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<font size="+1"><b>Writing Functions in R</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write a function in R which will call the sweep subroutine from 
part 1 of this assignment.  Name the R function "<tt>bsweep</tt>" to avoid
conflict with the R function "<tt>sweep</tt>" which performs a different
operation on a matrix.  There should be two arguments to the R function;
the matrix to be swept, and a vector of indices
of the columns which are to be swept.  Verify that the function works 
by performing a regression with it. 
Don't forget that
R stores it's matrices by columns, not by rows.
<div class="p"><!----></div>
</li>

<li>
<font size="+1"><b>Non-linear regression</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write a program in C to perform non-linear regression.  The
core of your program should be a function which is passed the data for
the regression and the name of functions  which will evaluate the 
non-linear function being fit and its gradient.  (Make sure to 
write your function so you can change the routines which will be
evaluating the regression function and the gradient through the argument
list.) Use the Gauss-Newton
algorithm with capability for step halving when necessary, and notice 
that there are a variety of ways to determine the
iterative step directions: Cholesky decomposition of J(<font face="symbol">q</font
>)<font face="symbol">¢</font
>J(<font face="symbol">q</font
>) 
followed by solution of a triangular system of equations 
or regression of f(<font face="symbol">q</font
>) on J(<font face="symbol">q</font
>)
to name two. Test your program on the two data sets contained in the files
prob1 and prob2 in the s243 samples directory. A description of the content
of these files is in the files prob1.des and prob2.des in the same
directory (<tt>&#126;s243/samples</tt>). If you have the time and 
inclination, you can verify your results using R, SAS,
or any 
other method you know of.

<font size="+1"><b>EXTRA CREDIT I: R Function for Stepwise Regression</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write an R function to perform backward deletion using the bsweep
function which you wrote in part 1.   The function should have an
option for inclusion of an intercept, and should return a logical
matrix which has one row for each model investigated, and a column for
each variable containing either <tt>TRUE</tt> or <tt>FALSE</tt>, depending
on whether or not each variable is involved in that regression.
How would you change the design of the function in order to make
it run more quickly?
<div class="p"><!----></div>

<li>
<font size="+1"><b>EXTRA CREDIT II: R Function for Non-Linear Regression</b></font>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Write an R interface to the non-linear regression
program written in part 3.  The interface should allow you to define
the non-linear function and its gradient as functions in R which will
be passed to your program using the <tt>call_R</tt> function. (If you choose
to do this part of the assignment and run into problems, don't hesitate
to ask questions!)
