**Summary:** Materials from a course I took on Statistical Computing at UC Berkeley in Fall 1997

**Description:** This repository is a collection of notes and assignments (with
    solutions) for a course I took at UC Berkeley called "STAT 243: Statistical Computing."

**Instructor:** [Phil Spector](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~spector/)

**Course Homepage:** [www.stat.Berkeley.EDU/classes/s243](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/classes/s243/)

**N.B.** some of the programs depend on
[the blas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms) and
the programs in the [lib](https://github.com/williamdemeo/statcomp/tree/master/lib) directory.
