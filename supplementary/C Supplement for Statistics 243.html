 </p><h3> Supplementary C Programming Information</h3>
Statistics 243 Fall, 1998
<ol><li>
One useful technique when writing a program is to allow the user to
specify arguments on the command line, for example the name of a file
to be read, or values to control the execution of the program.  Although
the <tt> main</tt> program is often defined with no arguments, you can always
use two optional arguments to <tt> main</tt> to get access to any 
information which was provided on the command line, namely <tt> argc</tt>,
which is an integer containing the number of arguments passed on the command 
line (including the name of the program itself), and <tt> argv</tt>, which is an 
array of pointers to the (null-terminated)
values of the arguments, with the convention that 
<tt> argv[0]</tt> points to the name of the program.
Memory for the values is automatically
provided by the operating system, and is guaranteed to be stable throughout
the execution of the program.
<p>
The following program shows how to declare the necessary
arguments, as well as how to access the values of command line arguments
passed to the program.
</p><pre>main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
   short i;

   printf("There were %d arguments passed to %s\n", argc, argv[0]);
   printf("The arguments were:\n");
   for(i=1;i&lt;argc;i++)printf("Argument %d: %s\n",i,argv[i]);
}
</pre>
<p>
Note that arguments passed to programs are always null-terminated character 
strings, and should be converted (using <tt> atoi</tt>, <tt> atof</tt> or 
<tt> sscanf</tt>) if a numeric value is desired.  For an example of how to parse
UNIX style command line options (with hyphens), see 
<a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~williamdemeo/C/samples/sq.c"><tt>~s243/samples/sq.c</tt></a> or the man page
for <tt>getopt</tt>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
Virtually all the I/O that you need when dealing with numerical operations
will be formatted I/O, using <tt> fprintf</tt>, <tt> fscanf</tt>, and related 
functions.  However, it is occasionally useful to be able to read input
as simply characters, and then process it within your program, or to be
able to construct a line of text as a character string, and then write 
it to a file.  To perform these kinds of tasks, you can open a file using
<tt> fopen</tt>, and then pass the resulting <tt> FILE</tt> pointer to one of 
the following routines:<br> 
<p>
To read or write one line at a time (where a line is defined by the presence
of a newline character):
</p><pre>    fgets(char *line, int maxlen, FILE *fp);
    fputs(char *line, FILE *fp);
</pre>
To read or write one character at a time:
<pre>    char getc(FILE *fp);   /* returns the next character from a file */
    putc(char c, FILE *fp);
</pre>
These routines are declared in <tt> stdio.h</tt>, so that file should be 
<tt> #include</tt>d in any program which calls them.
<p>
</p></li><li>
There are even lower level I/O routines available which simply transfer 
the internal representations of objects to a file, or tranfer bytes of
information from a file to a specified location in the computer's memory.
For example, you could scan in a set of formatted numbers, and then 
write their internal binary representations to a file, which could very
quickly and efficiently be read back into memory at a later time. (This
is essentially the way virtual memory works.)  
You can pass a <tt> FILE</tt>
pointer from <tt> fopen</tt> to the <tt> fread</tt> or <tt> fwrite</tt> function
s to
acheive these goals.
The prototypes for these functions are as follows:
<pre>    int fread(char *from, int size, int nitems, FILE *fp);
    int fwrite(char *to, int size, int nitems, FILE *fp);
</pre>
<p>
The <tt> fread</tt> and <tt> fwrite</tt> functions return the number of items
actually read.  They are declared in <tt> &lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>
Although C has a reputation for not providing much support for character
strings, there are a few handy functions available as part of the standard
library.  Most of these routines expect that strings will be null terminated,
so make sure you allow enough space to include the null character at the 
end of the string.  When your string is not null-terminated, or you only
want to manipulate a substring, use the version of the function with an
``<tt> n</tt>'' in its name.
<pre>   int strlen(char *s);    /* returns the length of a string */
   int strcpy(char *to, char *from);   /* imitates to = from */
   int strncpy(char *to, char *from, int n);
   char *index(char *s,char c)        /* ptr to first c in s */
   int strcmp(char *s1, char *s2); /* &lt;0 if s1&lt;s2, 0 if s1==s2, &gt;0 if s1&gt;s2 */
   int strncmp(char *s1, char *s2, int n);
</pre>
There are quite a few other string handling functions; type <tt> man string</tt>
for more information.
