The BLAS routines, along with LAPACK and LINPACK, are contained in the 
Sun Performance Library, accessed through the -lsunperf flag.  The SPL
contains versions of these libraries optimized for use on SPARC computers.
You can see brief descriptions and calling sequences for the routines in
the blas library in the file /app/cmlib/doc/blas; there is also a man page
for lapack. The man pages for the individual routines in BLAS and LAPACK are
available through their names (for example, man ddot or man dsysv).

P.S. The complete reference manual for the Sun Performance Libraries
is in the postscript files /opt/SUNWspro/READMEs/libsunperf*

You can view them online with ghostview.
